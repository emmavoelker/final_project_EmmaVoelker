# Emma's Final Project 

## Part One
### Project Outline 

For my final project, I am interested in exploring the connection between art education and academic performance in school children K-12. During my time as an artist and participant in art education, I have come to understand that participation in visual arts classes in K-12 classrooms contributes positively to students' performance in other academic areas. However, I have never understood the specific data points that correlate to this conclusion.

Being an artist myself and studying arts management, I of course believe greatly in the benefit of art education. However, not all audiences have participated in the arts, nor might they have had access to. Therefore, I would like to explore and demonstrate to audiences the positive correlation, and therefore a pressing need, to include art education in K-12 curriculums. 

Art Education and Academic Performance: Investigate the correlation between exposure to art education (in schools or extracurricular activities) and academic performance. Analyze academic data alongside participation in art programs.
