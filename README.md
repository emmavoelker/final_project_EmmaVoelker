# Emma's Final Project 

## Part One
### Project Outline 

For my final project, I am interested in exploring the connection between art education and academic performance in school children K-12. During my time as an artist and participant in art education, I have come to understand that participation in visual arts classes in K-12 classrooms contributes positively to students' performance in other academic areas. However, I have never understood the specific data points that correlate to this conclusion.

Being an artist myself and studying arts management, I of course believe greatly in the benefit of art education. However, not all audiences have participated in the arts, nor might they have had access to. Therefore, I would like to explore and demonstrate to audiences the positive correlation, and therefore a pressing need, to include art education in K-12 curriculums. 

Art Education and Academic Performance: Investigate the correlation between exposure to art education (in schools or extracurricular activities) and academic performance. Analyze academic data alongside participation in art programs.

The project outline is as follows:

### Working Copy of Datasets 
#### First Data Set 
Link: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2019-2020-arts-survey-data

The first data set I'll be utilizing "collects information on student participation in and access to arts education at NYCDOE schools." This dataset specifically looks at New York City area schools, drawing data from local students. I will utilize it to benchmark with data collected from the same year in NYCDOE schools that demonstrate students' performance in different academic levels, drawing conclusions based on the correlations I observe between these two data sets. 

#### Second Data Set

The second data set, or rather data source, was published by Americans for the Arts. A key source of art-education-related data and analysis, the non-profit promotes and advocates for K-12 art education. Though it is not a csv file of data points, recreating some of these figures (with the appropriate citations) will assist me greatly in telling my own story about art education and its impact on student performance.  

#### Third Data Set 
Link: https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED529766.pdf

Another data set which is not a typical set of data points, but rather information that I will be able to use and reference in my own work. This source in particular is helpful because it breaks down the impact of an arts education on specific areas of academic performance, such as critical thinking skills, mathematics, and social skills. It will prove helpful in the more specific portions of my project where I explain more in-depth effects on certain parts of a well-rounded education. 

#### Fourth Data Set

2) https://www.artsedsearch.org/study/the-effects-of-the-arts-impact-curriculum-upon-student-performance-on-the-ohio-fourth-grade-proficiency-test/
3) https://www.artsedsearch.org/study/investigating-causal-effect-of-arts-education-experiences-experimental-evidence-from-houstons-arts-access-initiative/
4) https://www.artsedsearch.org/study/using-arts-integration-to-make-science-learning-memorable-in-the-upper-elementary-grades-a-quasi-experimental-study/

The grouping of "fourth" sources is unique in that they all come from the same source: ArtsEdResearch. ArtsEdReserach is a hub for data relating to the impact of arts education on academic performance. Their self-identified role is an "online clearinghouse of research focused on the outcomes of arts education for students and educators, both during and outside the school day."

The studies I have chosen will be used to demonstrate specific examples and studies that relate to demonstrated instances of a positive correlation between the discussed variables. Each study is to be found on its own, searched for separately from ArtsEdResearch, which serves as a summary database of these research topics. 

#### Fifth Data Set 
Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-023-00187-6#data-availability

Lastly, I am including this final data set in the hope that I am able to access the original data via request to the author. Though the data is not publicly available, the source states that "The data that support the findings of this study are available on request from the corresponding author. The data are not publicly available due to privacy restrictions."

If I am not able to access the orignial dataset, I hope to reference points and data already synthesized in this study within my own data story (again with proper citations and credit). 

### First Sketches 
As a working first draft, I plan to include the following illustrated data visualization types. As for some of the breakdowns regarding classes taken, current attitudes towards the implementation of arts education, etc., I also intend to use pie charts. Each of the included headings correlates to the determined numbers on my outline, as I intend to structure the project in this way. Though the data contained under each section will be a wide variety of topics, the headings seek to include all discussed data in a way that is engaging and attention-grabbing.

### Method and Mediums 
I plan to complete my final project in Shorthand, as discussed in class. I have never used the platform before, and one of my personal goals for this course was to learn and engage with new software and methods of displaying data visuals. I plan to create a project that viewers can scroll through and that tells a story in a comprehensive but detailed manner.
